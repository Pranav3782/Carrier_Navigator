## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The application is built with a simple yet powerful stack, all within the Python ecosystem:

* **Framework**: **Streamlit** is used for the core web application and user interface components.
* **Data Manipulation**: **Pandas** structures the final recommendation scores for sorting and visualization.
* **Data Visualization**: **Plotly Express** creates the interactive and responsive bar chart.
* **Styling**: **CSS** is used for custom styling to enhance the default look and feel of the application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works Internally

The application's logic is straightforward and effective:

1.  **Data Collection**: The app uses Streamlit's `session_state` to store your inputs as you move through the multi-step form.
2.  **Matching Algorithm**: After you submit your information, the app iterates through each career in its database. For each one, it calculates a match score.
3.  **Scoring**: The score is based on two key metrics:
    * **Skill Score**: The percentage of a career's required skills that you possess.
    * **Interest Score**: The percentage of a career's associated interests that you have.
4.  **Final Score Calculation**: The overall match score is the average of the skill and interest scores.
5.  **Results Display**: The careers are sorted by their final score and presented in a clean, two-column layout with detailed expanders and a summary chart.
